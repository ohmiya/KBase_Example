<p>Transform Service</p>

<p>This KBase service supports translations and transformations of data types, including converting external file formats to KBase objects, converting KBase objects to external file formats, and converting KBase objects to other KBase objects, either objects of different types or objects of the same type but different versions.</p>

<p>A type string copied from WS spec. Specifies the type and its version in a single string in the format [module].[typename]-[major].[minor]:</p>

<p>module - a string. The module name of the typespec containing the type. typename - a string. The name of the type as assigned by the typedef statement. For external type, it start with &ldquo;e_&rdquo;. major - an integer. The major version of the type. A change in the major version implies the type has changed in a non-backwards compatible way. minor - an integer. The minor version of the type. A change in the minor version implies that the type has changed in a way that is backwards compatible with previous type definitions.</p>

<p>In many cases, the major and minor versions are optional, and if not provided the most recent version will be used.</p>

<p>Example: MyModule.MyType-3.1</p>
