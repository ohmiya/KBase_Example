<p>A contig is thought of as composing a part of the DNA associated with a specific genome. It is represented as an ID (including the genome ID) and a ContigSequence. We do not think of strings of DNA from, say, a metgenomic sample as &quot;contigs&quot;, since there is no associated genome (these would be considered ContigSequences). This use of the term &quot;ContigSequence&quot;, rather than just &quot;DNA sequence&quot;, may turn out to be a bad idea. For now, you should just realize that a Contig has an associated genome, but a ContigSequence does not.</p>

<p>ContigSequences are strings of DNA. Contigs have an associated genome, but ContigSequences do not. We can think of random samples of DNA as a set of ContigSequences. There are no length constraints imposed on ContigSequences -- they can be either very short or very long. The basic unit of data that is moved to/from the database is the ContigChunk, from which ContigSequences are formed. The key of a ContigSequence is the sequence&#39;s MD5 identifier.</p>

<p>It has the following fields:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="length">length</dt>
<dd>

<p>number of base pairs in the contig</p>

<p>The Kbase will support the maintenance of protein families (as sets of Features with associated translations). We are initially only supporting the notion of a family as composed of a set of isofunctional homologs. That is, the families we initially support should be thought of as containing protein-encoding genes whose associated sequences all implement the same function (we do understand that the notion of &quot;function&quot; is somewhat ambiguous, so let us sweep this under the rug by calling a functional role a &quot;primitive concept&quot;). We currently support families in which the members are protein sequences as well. Identical protein sequences as products of translating distinct genes may or may not have identical functions. This may be justified, since in a very, very, very few cases identical proteins do, in fact, have distinct functions.</p>

<p>A feature (sometimes also called a gene) is a part of a genome that is of special interest. Features may be spread across multiple DNA sequences (contigs) of a genome, but never across more than one genome. Each feature in the database has a unique ID that functions as its ID in this table. Normally a Feature is just a single contigous region on a contig. Features have types, and an appropriate choice of available types allows the support of protein-encoding genes, exons, RNA genes, binding sites, pathogenicity islands, or whatever.</p>

<p>It has the following fields:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="feature_type">feature_type</dt>
<dd>

<p>Code indicating the type of this feature. Among the codes currently supported are &quot;peg&quot; for a protein encoding gene, &quot;bs&quot; for a binding site, &quot;opr&quot; for an operon, and so forth.</p>

<p>We use the concept of ProteinSequence as an amino acid string with an associated MD5 value. It is easy to access the set of Features that relate to a ProteinSequence. While function is still associated with Features (and may be for some time), publications are associated with ProteinSequences (and the inferred impact on Features is through the relationship connecting ProteinSequences to Features).</p>

<p>It has the following fields:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="sequence2">sequence</dt>
<dd>

<p>The sequence contains the letters corresponding to the protein&#39;s amino acids.</p>

<p>A feature is a set of DNA sequence fragments, the location of which are specified by the fields of this relationship. Most features are a single contiguous fragment, so they are located in only one DNA sequence; however, for search optimization reasons, fragments have a maximum length, so even a single contiguous feature may participate in this relationship multiple times. Thus, it is better to use the CDMI API methods to get feature positions and sequences as those methods rejoin the fragements for contiguous features. A few features belong to multiple DNA sequences. In that case, however, all the DNA sequences belong to the same genome. A DNA sequence itself will frequently have thousands of features connected to it.</p>

This allows you to speak of not only protein-encoding genes (PEGs) and RNAs, but also binding sites, large regions, etc. The location of a fid is defined as a list of &quot;location of a contiguous DNA string&quot; pieces (see the description of the type &quot;location&quot;)</p>

<p>A protein_family is thought of as a set of isofunctional, homologous protein sequences. This is not exactly what other groups have meant by &quot;protein families&quot;.

<p>The concept of &quot;role&quot; or &quot;functional role&quot; is basically an atomic functional unit. The &quot;function of a protein&quot; is made up of one or more roles. That is, a bifunctional protein with an assigned function of</p>

<p>would implement two distinct roles (the &quot;function1 / function2&quot; notation is intended to assert that the initial part of the protein implements function1, and the terminal part of the protein implements function2). It is worth noting that a protein often implements multiple roles due to broad specificity. In this case, we suggest describing the protein function as</p>

<pre><code>     function1 @ function2</code></pre>

<p>That is the &#39; / &#39; separator is used to represent multiple roles implemented by distinct domains of the protein, while &#39; @ &#39; is used to represent multiple roles implemented by distinct domains.</p>

<p>A substem is composed of two components: a set of roles that are gathered to be annotated simultaneously and a spreadsheet depicting the proteins within each genome that implement the roles. The set of roles may correspond to a pathway, a complex, an inventory (say, &quot;transporters&quot;) or whatever other principle an annotator used to formulate the subsystem.</p>

<p>The subsystem spreadsheet is a list of &quot;rows&quot;, each representing the subsytem in a specific genome. Each row includes a variant code (indicating what version of the molecular machine exists in the genome) and cells. Each cell is a 2-tuple:</p>

<pre><code>     [role,protein-encoding genes that implement the role in the genome]</code></pre>

<p>Annotators construct subsystems, and in the process impose a controlled vocabulary for roles and functions.</p>

Each allele is associated with a position on a contig of the reference genome. Prior analysis has associated traits with the alleles that impact them. We are interested in supporting operations that locate genes in the region of an allele (i.e., genes of the reference genome that are in a region containining an allele). Similarly, we wish to locate the alleles that impact a trait, map the alleles to regions, loacte the possibly impacted genes, relate these to subsystems, etc.</p>

<p>Reactions do not connect directly to roles. Rather, the conceptual model is that one or more roles together form a complex. A complex implements one or more reactions. The actual data relating to a complex is spread over two entities: Complex and ReactionComplex. It is convenient to be able to offer access to the complex name, the reactions it implements, and the roles that make it up in a single invocation.</p>
