<p>Information about a subdata selection constant_ref - can be set as a fixed reference(s) to data objects so that the dropdown is always populated with a particular WS object - useful for say populating based on an ontology or some other library of default terms, such as compounds parameter_id - pick the terms from a user specified parameter in the same method path_to_subdata - specific path to a list or map that should be used to populate the fields selection_id - If the path_to_subdata is to a list of objects, use this to specify which field of that object should be used as the primary ID selection_description - Use this to specify (if the subdata is a list or map) which fields should be included as a short description of the selection. For features, for instance, this may include the feature function, or feature aliases. description_template - Defines how the description of items is rendered using Handlebar templates (use the name of items in the selection_description list as variable names)</p>

<p>Defines a parameter field that allows autocomplete based on subdata of an existing object. For instance, selection of feature ids from a Genome object. It will appear as a text field with dropdown similar to selection of other WS data objects. placeholder - placeholder text to display in the field multiselection - if true, then multiple selections are allowed in a single input field. This will override the allow_multiple option (which allows user addition) of additional fields. If true, then this parameter will return a list. Default= false show_src_obj - if true, then the dropdown will indicate the ids along with some text indicating what data object the subdata was retrieved from. Default=true allow_custom - if true, then user specified inputs not found in the list are accepted. if false, users can only select from the valid list of selections. Default=false</p>
