=head1 NAME

CDMI_API

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The CDMI_API defines the component of the Kbase API that supports interaction with
instances of the CDM (Central Data Model).  A basic familiarity with these routines
will allow the user to extract data from the CS (Central Store).  We anticipate
supporting numerous sparse CDMIs in the PS (Persistent Store).

=head2 Basic Themes

There are several broad categories of routines supported in the CDMI-API.

The simplest is set of "get entity" routines -- each returning data
extracted from instances of a single entity type.  These routines all take
as input a list of ids referencing instances of a single type of entity.
They construct as output a mapping which takes as input an id and
associates as output a set of fields from that instance of the entity.  Each
routine allows the user to specify which fields are desired.

For example, assume you have an input file "Staphylococci," which is a list of genome IDs for each species of Staphylococcus in the database. The get_entity_Genome command is used to retrieve detailed information about each genome in the file. By using different modifiers, you can specify what kind of information you want to display. In this example, the modifier "contigs" was used. Thus, the number next to the genome ID in the output file indicates the number of contigs each Staphylococcus genome has. For a list of available modifiers relating to each identity, please refer to the ER model.

        > / cat Staphylococci | cut -f 1 | get_entity_Genome - f contigs
        kb|g.134        2
        kb|g.636        1
        kb|g.2506        15
        kb|g.9303        1
        kb|g.3801        87
        kb|g.2025        46
        kb|g.2516        13
        kb|g.2603        33
        kb|g.19928        2
        kb|g.1852        131
        kb|g.8476        1
        kb|g.2742        46

To use these routines effectively, a user will need to gradually
become familiar with the entities supported in the CDM.  We suggest
perusing the entity-relationship model that underlies the CDM to
get a good introduction.

The next simplest set of routines provide the "get relationship" routines.  These
take as input a list of ids for a specific entity type, and the give access
to the relationship nodes associated with each entity.  Thus, get_relationship_WasSubmittedBy takes the input genome ID and outputs the ID with an added column showing the source of that particular genome. It is essential to be able to navigate the ER model to successfully implement these commands, since not all relationship types are applicable to each entity.

        > / echo 'kb|g.0' | get_relationship_WasSubmittedBy -to id
        kb|g.0        SEED

Of the remaining CDMI-API routines, most are used to extract data by
"crossing one or more relationships".  Thus,

        my $references = $kbO->fids_to_literature($fids)

takes as input a list of feature ids referenced by the variable $fids.  It
creates a hash ($references) which maps each input key to a list of literature
references.  The construction of the literature references for a given ID involves
crossing relationships from the entity 'Feature' to 'ProteinSequence' to 'Publication'.
We have attempted to package this specific search in a convenient form.  We anticipate
that the number of queries of this last class will grow (especially as new entities are
added to the model).

=head2 Batching queries

A majority of the CS-API routines take a list of ids as input.  Each id may be thought
of as input to a query that produces an output result.  We support processing an input list,
since the performance (which is usually governed by network interactions) is much better
if you process a batch of items, rather than invoking the API repeatedly for each of the
ids.  Normally, the output would be a mapping (a hash for Perl versions) from the
input ids to the output results.  Thus, a routine like

             fids_to_literature

will take a list of feature ids as input.  The returned value will be a mapping from
feature ids (fids) to publication references.

It is a little inconvenient to batch your requests by supplying a list of fids,
but the performance will be much better in most cases.  Please note that you are
controlling the granularity of each request, and in most cases the size of the input
list is not critical.  However, you should note that while batching up hundreds or thousands
of input ids at a time should work just fine, millions may well cause things to break (e.g.,
you may exhaust local memory in your machine as the output results are returned).  As
machines get larger, the appropriate size of the input lists may become largely irrelevant.
For now, we recommend that you experiment a bit and use common sense.

=item Description

We try to associate features and publications, when the publications constitute
supporting evidence of the function.  We connect a paper to a feature when
we believe that an "expert" has asserted that the function of the feature
is basically what we have associated with the feature.  Thus, we might
attach a paper reporting the crystal structure of a protein, even though
the paper is clearly not the paper responsible for the original characterization.
Our position in this matter is somewhat controversial, but we are seeking to
characterize some assertions as relatively solid, and this strategy seems to
support that goal.  Please note that we certainly wish we could also
capture original publications, and when experts can provide those
connections, we hope that they will help record the associations.

Kbase supports the creation and maintence of protein families.  Each family is intended to contain a set

fids_to_protein_families supports access to the features that have been grouped into a family.
Ideally, each feature in a family would have the same assigned function.  This is not
always true, but probably should be.

=item Description

One of the most powerful clues to function relates to conserved clusters of genes on
the chromosome (in prokaryotic genomes).  We have attempted to record pairs of genes
that tend to occur close to one another on the chromosome.  To meaningfully do this,
we need to construct similarity-based mappings between genes in distinct genomes.
We have constructed such mappings for many (but not all) genomes maintained in the
Kbase CS.  The prokaryotic geneomes in the CS are grouped into OTUs by ribosomal
RNA (genomes within a single OTU have SSU rRNA that is greater than 97% identical).
If two genes occur close to one another (i.e., corresponding genes occur close
to one another), then we assign a score, which is the number of distinct OTUs
in which such clustering is detected.  This allows one to normalize for situations
in which hundreds of corresponding genes are detected, but they all come from
very closely related genomes.

The significance of the score relates to the number of genomes in the database.
We recommend that you take the time to look at a set of scored pairs and determine
approximately what percentage appear to be actually related for a few cutoff values.

=item Description

A "location" is a sequence of "regions".  A region is a contiguous set of bases
in a contig.  We work with locations in both the string form and as structures.
fids_to_locations takes as input a list of fids.  For each fid, a structured location
is returned.  The location is a list of regions; a region is given as a pointer to
a list containing

             the contig,
             the beginning base in the contig (from 1).
             the strand (+ or -), and
             the length

Note that specifying a region using these 4 values allows you to represent a single
base-pair region on either strand unambiguously (which giving begin/end pairs does
not achieve).

It is frequently the case that one wishes to look up the genes that
occur in a given region of a contig.  Location_to_fids can be used to extract
such sets of genes for each region in the input set of regions.  We define a gene
as "occuring" in a region if the location of the gene overlaps the designated region.

For performance reasons, you can submit a batch of proteins (i.e., a list of proteins),
and for each input protein, you get back a set (possibly empty) of protein_families.
Specific collections of families (e.g., FIGfams) usually require that a protein be in
at most one family.  However, we will be integrating protein families from a number of
sources, and so a protein can be in multiple families.

not yet even be in a sequenced genome).  Annotators attempt to use best
judgement when associating literature and proteins.  Publication references
include [pubmed ID,URL for the paper, title of the paper].  In some cases,
the URL and title are omitted.  In theory, we can extract them from PubMed
and we will attempt to do so.

The routine proteins_to_functions allows users to access functions associated with
specific protein sequences.  The input proteins are given as a list of MD5 values
(these MD5 values each correspond to a specific protein sequence).  For each input
MD5 value, a list of [feature-id,function] pairs is constructed and returned.
Note that there are many cases in which a single protein sequence corresponds
to the translation associated with multiple protein-encoding genes, and each may
have distinct functions (an undesirable situation, we grant).

This function allows you to access all of the functions assigned (by all annotation
groups represented in Kbase) to each of a set of sequences.

=item Description

The routine proteins_to_roles allows a user to gather the set of functional
roles that are associated with specifc protein sequences.  A single protein
sequence (designated by an MD5 value) may have numerous associated functions,
since functions are treated as an attribute of the feature, and multiple
features may have precisely the same translation.  In our experience,
it is not uncommon, even for the best annotation teams, to assign
distinct functions (and, hence, functional roles) to identical
protein sequences.

For each input MD5 value, this routine gathers the set of features (fids)
that share the same sequence, collects the associated functions, expands
these into functional roles (for multi-functional proteins), and returns
the set of roles that results.

Note that, if the user wishes to see the specific features that have the
assigned fiunctional roles, they should use proteins_to_functions instead (it
returns the fids associated with each assigned function).

Since we accumulate data relating to the co-occurrence (i.e., chromosomal
clustering) of genes in prokaryotic genomes,  we can note which pairs of genes tend to co-occur.
From this data, one can compute the protein families that tend to co-occur (i.e., tend to
cluster on the chromosome).  This allows one to formulate conjectures for unclustered pairs, based
on clustered pairs from the same protein_families.

=item Description

co-occurence_evidence is used to retrieve the detailed pairs of genes that go into the
computation of co-occurence scores.  The scores reflect an estimate of the number of distinct OTUs that
contain an instance of a co-occuring pair.  This routine returns as evidence a list of all the pairs that
went into the computation.

The input to the computation is a list of pairs for which evidence is desired.

The returned output is a list of elements. one for each input pair.  Each output element
is a 2-tuple: the input pair and the evidence for the pair.  The evidence is a list of pairs of
fids that are believed to correspond to the input pair.

In some cases, one wishes to know just the lengths of the contigs, rather than their
actual DNA sequence (e.g., suppose that you wished to know if a gene boundary occured within
100 bp of the end of the contig).  To avoid requiring a user to access the entire DNA sequence,
we offer the ability to retrieve just the contig lengths.  Input to the routine is a list of contig IDs.
The routine returns a mapping from contig IDs to lengths

contigs_to_md5s can be used to acquire MD5 values for each of a list of contigs.
The quickest way to determine whether two contigs are identical is to compare their

The routine genomes_to_taxonomies can be used to retrieve taxonomic information for
each of a list of input genomes.  For each genome in the input list of genomes, a list of
taxonomic groups is returned.  Kbase will use the groups maintained by NCBI.  For an NCBI
taxonomic string like

     cellular organisms;
     Bacteria;
     Proteobacteria;
     Gammaproteobacteria;
     Enterobacteriales;
     Enterobacteriaceae;
     Escherichia;
     Escherichia coli

associated with the strain 'Escherichia coli 1412', this routine would return a list of these
taxonomic groups:


     ['Bacteria',
      'Proteobacteria',
      'Gammaproteobacteria',
      'Enterobacteriales',
      'Enterobacteriaceae',
      'Escherichia',
      'Escherichia coli',
      'Escherichia coli 1412'
     ]

That is, the initial "cellular organisms" has been deleted, and the strain ID has
been added as the last "grouping".

The output is a mapping from genome IDs to lists of the form shown above.

=item Description

A user can invoke genomes_to_subsystems to rerieve the names of the subsystems
relevant to each genome.  The input is a list of genomes.  The output is a mapping
from genome to a list of 2-tuples, where each 2-tuple give a variant code and a
subsystem name.  Variant codes of -1 (or *-1) amount to assertions that the
genome contains no active variant.  A variant code of 0 means "work in progress",
and presence or absence of the subsystem in the genome should be undetermined.

=item Description

The routine subsystems_to_fids allows the user to map subsystem names into the fids that
occur in genomes in the subsystems.  Specifically, the input is a list of subsystem names.
What is returned is a mapping from subsystem names to a "genome-mapping".  The genome-mapping
takes genome IDs to 2-tuples that capture the variant code of the genome and the fids from
the genome that are included in the subsystem.

=item Description

The subsystem_to_spreadsheet routine allows a user to extract the subsystem spreadsheets for
a specified set of subsystem names.  In the returned output, each subsystem is mapped
to a hash that takes as input a genome ID and maps it to the "row" for the genome in the subsystem.
The "row" is itself a 2-tuple composed of the variant code, and a mapping from role descriptions to
lists of fids.  We suggest writing a simple test script to get, say, the subsystem named
'Histidine Degradation', extracting the spreadsheet, and then using something like Dumper to make
sure that it all makes sense.

=item Description

Different groups have made assertions of function for numerous protein sequences.
The equiv_sequence_assertions allows the user to gather function assertions from
all of the sources.  Each assertion includes a field indicating whether the person making
the assertion viewed themself as an "expert".  The routine gathers assertions for all
proteins having identical protein sequence.

fids_to_protein_sequences allows the user to look up the amino acid sequences
corresponding to each of a set of fids.  You can also get the sequence from proteins (i.e., md5 values).
This routine saves you having to look up the md5 sequence and then accessing
the protein string in a separate call.

A "function" is a set of "roles" (often called "functional roles");

                F1 / F2  (where F1 and F2 are roles)  is a function that implements
                          two functional roles in different domains of the protein.
                F1 @ F2 implements multiple roles through broad specificity
                F1; F2  is thought to implement F1 or f2 (uncertainty)

            You often wish to find the fids in one or more genomes that
            implement specific functional roles.  To do this, you can use
            roles_to_fids.

=item Description

roles_to_complexes allows a user to connect Roles to Complexes,
from there, the connection exists to Reactions (although in the
actual ER-model model, the connection from Complex to Reaction goes through
ReactionComplex).  Since Roles also connect to fids, the connection between
fids and Reactions is induced.

The "name_parameter" can be 0, 1 or 'only'. If 1, then the compound name will 
be included with the ID in the output. If only, the compound name will be included 
instead of the ID. If 0, only the ID will be included. The default is 0.

=item Description

text_search performs a search against a full-text index maintained 
for the CDMI. The parameter "input" is the text string to be searched for.
The parameter "entities" defines the entities to be searched. If the list
is empty, all indexed entities will be searched. The "start" and "count"
parameters limit the results to "count" hits starting at "start".

=over 4



=item Description

A fid is a "feature id".  A feature represents an ordered list of regions from
the contigs of a genome.  Features all have types.  This allows you to speak
of not only protein-encoding genes (PEGs) and RNAs, but also binding sites,
large regions, etc.  The location of a fid is defined as a list of
"location of a contiguous DNA string" pieces (see the description of the
type "location")

=over 4



=item Description

A protein_family is thought of as a set of isofunctional, homologous protein sequences.
This is not exactly what other groups have meant by "protein families".  There is no
hierarchy of super-family, family, sub-family.  We plan on loading different collections
of protein families, but in many cases there will need to be a transformation into the
concept used by Kbase.

=head2 role

=over 4



=item Description

The concept of "role" or "functional role" is basically an atomic functional unit.
The "function of a protein" is made up of one or more roles.  That is, a bifunctional protein
with an assigned function of

   5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.19) / Cytidylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.14)

would implement two distinct roles (the "function1 / function2" notation is intended to assert
that the initial part of the protein implements function1, and the terminal part of the protein
implements function2).  It is worth noting that a protein often implements multiple roles due
to broad specificity.  In this case, we suggest describing the protein function as

     function1 @ function2

That is the ' / ' separator is used to represent multiple roles implemented by distinct
domains of the protein, while ' @ ' is used to represent multiple roles implemented by
distinct domains.

=head2 subsystem

=over 4



=item Description

A substem is composed of two components: a set of roles that are gathered to be annotated
simultaneously and a spreadsheet depicting the proteins within each genome that implement
the roles.  The set of roles may correspond to a pathway, a complex, an inventory (say, "transporters")
or whatever other principle an annotator used to formulate the subsystem.

The subsystem spreadsheet is a list of "rows", each representing the subsytem in a specific genome.
Each row includes a variant code (indicating what version of the molecular machine exists in the
genome) and cells.  Each cell is a 2-tuple:

     [role,protein-encoding genes that implement the role in the genome]

Annotators construct subsystems, and in the process impose a controlled vocabulary
for roles and functions.

=head2 allele

=over 4



=item Description

We now have a number of types and functions relating to ObservationalUnits (ous),
alleles and traits.  We think of a reference genome and a set of ous that
have measured differences (SNPs) when compared to the reference genome.
Each allele is associated with a position on a contig of the reference genome.
Prior analysis has associated traits with the alleles that impact them.
We are interested in supporting operations that locate genes in the region
of an allele (i.e., genes of the reference genome that are in a region 
containining an allele).  Similarly, we wish to locate the alleles that
impact a trait, map the alleles to regions, loacte the possibly impacted genes,
relate these to subsystems, etc.

=item Description

Reactions do not connect directly to roles.  Rather, the conceptual model is that one or more roles
together form a complex.  A complex implements one or more reactions.  The actual data relating
to a complex is spread over two entities: Complex and ReactionComplex. It is convenient to be
able to offer access to the complex name, the reactions it implements, and the roles that make it up
in a single invocation.

=item Description

A correspondence is generated as a mapping of fids to fids.  The mapping
attempts to map a fid to another that performs the same function.  The
correspondence describes the regions that are similar, the strength of
the similarity, the number of genes in the chromosomal context that appear
to "correspond" and a score from 0 to 1 that loosely corresponds to 
confidence in the correspondence.

=item Description

A close_genomes is used to get a set of relatively close genomes (for
each input genome, a set of close genomes is calculated, but the
result should be viewed as quite approximate.  It is quite slow,
using similarities for a universal protein as the basis for the 
assessments.  It produces estimates of degree of similarity for
the universal proteins it samples.

Up to n genomes will be returned for each input genome.
