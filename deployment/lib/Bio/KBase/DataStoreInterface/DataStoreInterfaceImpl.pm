=item Description

The localize_handle function attempts to locate a shock server near
the service. The localize_handle function must be called before the
           Handle is initialized becuase when the handle is initialized, it is
           given a node id that maps to the shock server where the node was
           created.

=head2 Handle

=over 4



=item Description

Handle provides a unique reference that enables
access to the data files through functions
provided as part of the DSI. In the case of using
shock, the id is the node id. In the case of using
shock the value of type is shock. In the future 
these values should enumerated. The value of url is
the http address of the shock server, including the
protocol (http or https) and if necessary the port.
The values of remote_md5 and remote_sha1 are those
computed on the file in the remote data store. These
can be used to verify uploads and downloads.
