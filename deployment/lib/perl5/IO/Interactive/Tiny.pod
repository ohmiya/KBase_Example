=head1 VERSION

This document describes IO::Interactive::Tiny version 0.2


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::Interactive::Tiny;

    if ( IO::Interactive::Tiny::is_interactive() ) {
        print "I probably want text output.";
    }
    else {
        print "I probably want HTML output."; 
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the useful subset of L<IO::Interactive>â€™s functionality in the form of only having is_interactive().

Also gains ::Tiny-ness by not using L<version>, L<Carp>, or L<Scalar::Util>

=head1 INTERFACE 

Nothing in exported or exportable, that helps keep it '::Tiny'.


=head2 IO::Interactive::Tiny::is_interactive()

Same functionality as L<IO::Interactive:/is_interactive()>.


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

IO::Interactive::Tiny throws no warnings or errors of its own.


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

IO::Interactive::Tiny requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

None.


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-io-interactive-tiny@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.

=head1 About the '::Tiny' status

All info below is relative to IO::Interactive (v0.0.6).

See L<Acme::Tiny> for information on the ::Tiny suffix.

#3 is really really close:

    [ -- RSS Memory -- ]
      Baseline perl 1204
      IO::Interactive 2464 (+1260)
      IO::Interactive::Tiny 1332 (+128)
    
Even though "time" isn't really a ::Tiny factor, it does improve loading a bit:

   [ -- time -- ]
    Baseline perl
      real  0m0.014s
      user  0m0.004s
      sys   0m0.008s
    
    IO::Interactive
      real  0m0.023s
      user  0m0.013s
      sys   0m0.009s
    
    IO::Interactive::Tiny
      real  0m0.013s
      user  0m0.004s
      sys   0m0.008s
      
Regarding tests: t/01.is_interactive.t i the same as t/is_interactive.t in IO::Interactive
