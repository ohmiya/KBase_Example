get_entity_StudyExperiment

=head1 SYNOPSIS

get_entity_StudyExperiment [-c N] [-a] [--fields field-list] < ids > table.with.fields.added

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An Experiment is a collection of observational units with one originator that are part of a specific study.  An experiment may be conducted at more than one location and in more than one season or year.

Example:

    get_entity_StudyExperiment -a < ids > table.with.fields.added

would read in a file of ids and add a column for each field in the entity.

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the id. If some other column contains the id,
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the id.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.
