=head1 NAME

reactions_to_complexes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

reactions_to_complexes [arguments] < input > output

=head1 DESCRIPTION


Reactions are thought of as being either spontaneous or implemented by
one or more Complexes.  Complexes connect to Roles.  Hence, the connection of fids
or roles to reactions goes through Complexes.

Complexes are best thought of as things like the ribosome or ATP synthase, but
when a single protein is not grouped with others, we still think of it as a complex 
made up of a single member.

Example:

    reactions_to_complexes [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the reaction identifer. If another column contains the identifier
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head1 COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

Usage: reactions_to_complexes [arguments] < input > output


    -c num        Select the identifier from column num
    -i filename   Use filename rather than stdin for input
