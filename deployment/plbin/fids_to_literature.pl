=head1 NAME

fids_to_literature

=head1 SYNOPSIS

fids_to_literature [arguments] < input > output

=head1 DESCRIPTION


We try to associate features and publications, when the publications constitute
supporting evidence of the function.  We connect a paper to a feature when
we believe that an "expert" has asserted that the function of the feature
is basically what we have associated with the feature.  Thus, we might
attach a paper reporting the crystal structure of a protein, even though
the paper is clearly not the paper responsible for the original characterization.
Our position in this matter is somewhat controversial, but we are seeking to
characterize some assertions as relatively solid, and this strategy seems to
support that goal.  Please note that we certainly wish we could also
capture original publications, and when experts can provide those
connections, we hope that they will help record the associations.


Example:

    fids_to_literature [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head1 COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
