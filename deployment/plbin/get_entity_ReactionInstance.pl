=head1 NAME

get_entity_ReactionInstance

=head1 SYNOPSIS

get_entity_ReactionInstance [-c N] [-a] [--fields field-list] < ids > table.with.fields.added

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A reaction instance describes the specific implementation of
a reaction in a model.

Example:

    get_entity_ReactionInstance -a < ids > table.with.fields.added

would read in a file of ids and add a column for each field in the entity.

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the id. If some other column contains the id,
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the id.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head1 COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

Usage: get_entity_ReactionInstance [arguments] < ids > table.with.fields.added

    -a		    Return all available fields.
    -c num          Select the identifier from column num.
    -i filename     Use filename rather than stdin for input.
    --fields list   Choose a set of fields to return. List is a comma-separated list of strings.
    -a		    Return all available fields.
    --show-fields   List the available fields.

The following fields are available:

=over 4    

=item direction

reaction directionality (> for forward, < for backward, = for bidirectional) with respect to this model

=item protons

number of protons produced by this reaction when proceeding in the forward direction. If this is a transport reaction, these protons end up in the reaction instance's main location. If the number is negative, then the protons are consumed by the reaction rather than being produced.
