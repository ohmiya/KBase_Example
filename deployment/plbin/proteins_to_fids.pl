=head1 NAME

proteins_to_fids

=head1 SYNOPSIS

proteins_to_fids [arguments] < input > output

=head1 DESCRIPTION


proteins_to_fids takes as input a list of proteins (i.e., a list of md5s) and
returns for each a set of protein-encoding fids that have the designated
sequence as their translation.  That is, for each sequence, the returned fids will
be the entire set (within Kbase) that have the sequence as a translation.


Example:

    proteins_to_fids [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output. For each input line, there are multiple output lines, one for each fid the protein maps to. The fid is added to the end of each line.

=head1 COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

Usage: proteins_to_fids [arguments] < input > output


    -c num        Select the identifier from column num
    -i filename   Use filename rather than stdin for input
