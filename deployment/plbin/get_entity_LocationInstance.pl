=head1 NAME

get_entity_LocationInstance

=head1 SYNOPSIS

get_entity_LocationInstance [-c N] [-a] [--fields field-list] < ids > table.with.fields.added

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Location Instance represents a region of a cell
(e.g. cell wall, cytoplasm) as it appears in a specific
model.

Example:

    get_entity_LocationInstance -a < ids > table.with.fields.added

would read in a file of ids and add a column for each field in the entity.

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the id. If some other column contains the id,
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the id.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head1 COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

Usage: get_entity_LocationInstance [arguments] < ids > table.with.fields.added

    -a		    Return all available fields.
    -c num          Select the identifier from column num.
    -i filename     Use filename rather than stdin for input.
    --fields list   Choose a set of fields to return. List is a comma-separated list of strings.
    -a		    Return all available fields.
    --show-fields   List the available fields.

The following fields are available:

=over 4    

=item index

number used to distinguish between different instances of the same type of location in a single model. Within a model, any two instances of the same location must have difference compartment index values.

=item label

description used to differentiate between instances of the same location in a single model

=item pH

pH of the cell region, which is used to determine compound charge and pH gradient across cell membranes

=item potential

electrochemical potential of the cell region, which is used to determine the electrochemical gradient across cell membranes
