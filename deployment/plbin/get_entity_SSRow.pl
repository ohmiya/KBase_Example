=head1 NAME

get_entity_SSRow

=head1 SYNOPSIS

get_entity_SSRow [-c N] [-a] [--fields field-list] < ids > table.with.fields.added

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An SSRow (that is, a row in a subsystem spreadsheet)
represents a collection of functional roles present in the
Features of a single Genome.  The roles are part of a designated
subsystem, and the features associated with each role are included
in the row. That is, a row amounts to an instance of a subsystem as
it exists in a specific, designated genome.

Example:

    get_entity_SSRow -a < ids > table.with.fields.added

would read in a file of ids and add a column for each field in the entity.

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the id. If some other column contains the id,
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the id.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head1 COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

Usage: get_entity_SSRow [arguments] < ids > table.with.fields.added

    -a		    Return all available fields.
    -c num          Select the identifier from column num.
    -i filename     Use filename rather than stdin for input.
    --fields list   Choose a set of fields to return. List is a comma-separated list of strings.
    -a		    Return all available fields.
    --show-fields   List the available fields.

The following fields are available:

=over 4    

=item curated

This flag is TRUE if the assignment of the molecular machine has been curated, and FALSE if it was made by an automated program.

=item region

Region in the genome for which the row is relevant. Normally, this is an empty string, indicating that the machine covers the whole genome. If a subsystem has multiple rows for a genome, this contains a location string describing the region occupied by this particular row.
