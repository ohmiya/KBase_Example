=head1 NAME

get_entity_Annotation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

get_entity_Annotation [-c N] [-a] [--fields field-list] < ids > table.with.fields.added

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An annotation is a comment attached to a feature.
Annotations are used to track the history of a feature's
functional assignments and any related issues. The key is
the feature ID followed by a colon and a complemented ten-digit
sequence number.

Example:

    get_entity_Annotation -a < ids > table.with.fields.added

would read in a file of ids and add a column for each field in the entity.

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the id. If some other column contains the id,
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the id.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.
