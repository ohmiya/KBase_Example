                    3: The roles attached were all found with some probability in the BLAST search (OK)

                    Since there are multiple possibilities for complexes we need to decide when we should
                    call it OK and when we can't.

                    For now I will set separate flags for the occasion when one complex has roles and one doesn't

                    (and the calculated probability is artificially 0)

                    PARTIAL cases are treated as "has representatives" for this purpose.
                    Therefore, if only allComplexesHaveRepresentativeRoles is false, that means
                    there is incomplete information, but at least one subunit of one complex attached
                    to the reaction had a representative that we could use to calculate a probability.
